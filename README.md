# **Desing and implementation of a pipeline and scalar RISCV processor in FPGA**

  This project have like principal objective, the creation and evaluation of a pipeline and Scalar RISCV processor. Aditionally, it will be tested in various task in the automotive and antificially intelligence fields.

  ## Objectives

  - Design the microarchitecture of a scalar and pipelined RISC-V processor using VHDL or Verilog.
  - Simulate the operation of the processor in differents C-programs tests.
  - Synthetize and implement the processor on a DE0-Nano FPGA using Quartus Prime.
  - Load and validate the operation of the processor in the FPGA.
  - Evaluate processor performance in representative programs from the automotive and artificially inteligence sectors.

## Tools and technologies

- Intel Quartus Prime.
- DE0-Nano.
- Visual Studio Code IDE.
