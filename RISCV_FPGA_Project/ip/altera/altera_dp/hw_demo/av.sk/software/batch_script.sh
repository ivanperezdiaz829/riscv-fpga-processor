# DESCRIPTION:  This script builds a BSP and application based on the
#		DisplayPort pre-compiled libraries. It then programs
#		the device, downloads the ELF and launches a terminal
#               Pass in a cable number if you have multiple programming cables.
# Usage:        ./batch_script <optional cable number>
#               ex:  ./batch_script 2
#               If you are not sure of your cable number type
#               'jtagconfig' to list all the cables connected to the host (or remote cables)
