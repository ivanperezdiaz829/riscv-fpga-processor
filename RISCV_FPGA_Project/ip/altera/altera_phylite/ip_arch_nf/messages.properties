MSG_EXCEEDED_DLL_FMIN = The memory clock frequency of %1 MHz is illegal because it is below the minimum supported frequency of the FPGA's DLL. 
# TYPE = E
# STATUS = C

MSG_EXCEEDED_DLL_FMAX = The memory clock frequency of %1 MHz is illegal because it is above the maximum supported frequency of the FPGA's DLL. 
# TYPE = E
# STATUS = C

MSG_ILLEGAL_PLL = Unable to derive legal PLL parameter values for memory clock frequency %1 MHz when reference clock frequency is %2 MHz. 
# TYPE = E
# STATUS = C

MSG_ACTUAL_MEM_CLK_FREQ = Actual memory clock frequency is %1 MHz.
# TYPE = I
